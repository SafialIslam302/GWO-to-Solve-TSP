Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is arguably the most familiar combinatorial optimization problem. TSP is also very popular to check proficiency in any newly developed optimization method. In addition, the optimization methods which are developed for other tasks (e.g., numerical optimization), also test their proficiency in TSP. This study investigates a new technique to solve TSP based on a recently developed optimization method inspired by the hunting and social behavior of the grey wolf pack. Standard Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is developed for numerical optimization. In this study, GWO is modified and updated to solve TSP; and Swap Operators (SOs) and Swap Sequence (SS) are considered to adapt GWO for TSP. SS is an arrangement of several SOs in which each one holds two particular positions of a solution that might be swapped to make a new solution. In the proposed method, each grey wolf is considered as a TSP solution and SS is considered to update the solution. In every iteration, a new tour is formed by swapping the two position of a solution indicated by the SS to the previous solution. The proposed technique is tested on a several numbers of benchmark TSPs and final results are compared to the other prominent methods. Experimental consequences show that the proposed strategy is a decent technique to resolve TSP.
